# Lyceum Workbench

My multi-machine lab: g16 (desktop), e14 (laptop), m900 (server). Focused on Linux automation, backups, and creative workflows.

## Areas
- Storage tiers (hot/warm/cold), LVM, rsync/borg
- Samba + ACLs; remote access; CI/CD for home lab
- Music stack (LilyPond, Python Euclidean rhythms)

## Notes
