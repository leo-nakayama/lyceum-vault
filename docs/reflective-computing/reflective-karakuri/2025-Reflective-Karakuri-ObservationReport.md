## Observation Summary
*(Paste the latest Observation Report here — the structured block with Module/Function/InputData/Transformations/etc.)*

This report accompanies the CFP **“Reflective Karakuri”**, showing the deductive reasoning process of the AI as it decomposes the cultural, ethical, and computational dimensions of reflective self-awareness. Together, the CFP and this report represent a *complete reflective cycle* — from human conceptual inquiry to AI-assisted philosophical deduction.
