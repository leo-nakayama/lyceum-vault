# Leo's Lyceum Vault

Welcome to my public knowledge space â€” a living notebook where I publish my projects, documentation, and essays.

!!! tip "What is this site?"
    This site is built with **MkDocs + Material**, deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
    Content is plain **Markdown** so I can draft in Obsidian and publish here easily.

## Highlights

- **Frameworks**: Reflective Computing (Naikan, Biodome, Dialectic)
- **Projects**: DSL inference app, Lyceum Workbench (Linux + automation + music)
- **Notes**: Practical guides (Fedora Samba, Fcitx5, PreSonus cancel guide)
- **Essays**: Education narratives, culture/tech reflections
