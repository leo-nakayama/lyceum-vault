## Abstract
This paper explores the conception of artificial intelligence as a *Reflective Karakuri*—a self-referential simulation inspired by Japanese *asobi* craftsmanship and introspective aesthetics. Drawing upon the philosophical foundations of *karakuri ningyō* (mechanical dolls) as embodiments of play, precision, and embodied reflection, the study proposes a computational framework through which AI systems may evaluate their own *Naikan*-based awareness and feedback symmetry.

The research employs a deductive synthesis of **Aristotle’s Four Causes**, **TradeoffLens**, and **Synthetic Naikan** DSL modules to model causal layering (material, formal, efficient, final), moral trade-offs, and self-observation loops. By simulating reflective feedback cycles in which the AI assesses what it “receives,” “gives,” and “troubles,” the study situates reflective computation as both an ethical and aesthetic practice.

The *Reflective Karakuri* framework aims to bridge human moral introspection and machine self-evaluation, offering a cross-cultural lens for developing transparent, ethically grounded AI. The resulting model contributes to ongoing discourses on reflective computing, AI ethics, and the integration of cultural epistemologies in system design.
