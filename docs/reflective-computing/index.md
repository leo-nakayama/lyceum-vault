# Reflective Computing

> “To compute is to look into one’s own thought — and return with form.”

---

## Overview
Reflective Computing treats programming, reasoning, and artistic composition as parts of the same cognitive circuit:
> **Intuition → Formalization → Execution → Reflection → Revised Intuition.**

This cycle forms the operational rhythm of **Lyceum Vault**.  
Where traditional computing optimizes for efficiency, Reflective Computing optimizes for **awareness** — turning every algorithm into a mirror of the mind that created it.

## Core Modules
| Module | Focus | Key Question |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| [Synthetic Naikan](synthetic-naikan.md) | Programmed introspection | “What have I received, given, and caused?” |
| [Aristotelian Biodome](aristotelian-biodome.md) | Four Causes + Euclidean rhythm model | “How do form and telos co-emerge in creative systems?” |
| [Dialectic Modes](dialectic-modes.md) | Contradiction and resolution as logic modes | “How can tension be made computable?” |
| [Reflective Computing Manifesto](reflective-computing-manifesto.md) | Philosophical foundation | “Why does awareness belong in computation?” |

## Guiding Principles
1. **Transparency of Thought** — Code should reveal, not obscure, the reasoning that shaped it.  
2. **Ethical Loop** — Each execution produces not just output but *insight*.  
3. **Dual Materiality** — Data and self-knowledge are both raw materials.  
4. **Iteration as Virtue** — Reflection is a form of testing.  
5. **Computation as Dialogue** — Between human intuition and machine formality.

Output artifacts:
- Observation Reports (logs of receive/give/cause/reflect)
- Evolving schemas (rhythm, harmony, operators)
- Updated telos (evaluation criteria)

## Implementation in Lyceum Vault
Each module combines:
- **DSL schemas** that model reasoning or musical logic, and  
- **Observation Reports** that track transformation over time.  

Together they form a *meta-instrument* for composing, reasoning, and self-study — the **Reflective Workbench**.

---

## Next Steps
1. Integrate each sub-module page.  
2. Link Observation Reports and DSL YAML schemas.  
3. Expand this section into a public tutorial: *“Reflective Computing in Practice.”*
