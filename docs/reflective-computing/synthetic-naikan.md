# Synthetic Naikan

---

## 1. Overview
**Synthetic Naikan** models reflective introspection as an executable reasoning cycle.  
It derives from the Japanese practice *Naikan* (内観 – “looking within”) and re-expresses its three canonical questions in computational form:

1. What have I **received**?  
2. What have I **given**?  
3. What troubles or harm have I **caused**?

In Reflective Computing, these become **data flows**, **action logs**, and **error states**.  
Each run of the Naikan loop converts lived experience into a causal trace that can be examined, refined, and reused.

## 2. Formal Definition

```markdown
| Stage | Function | DSL Equivalent |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Receive** | Collect sensory, informational, or contextual input | `O_collect()` |
| **Give** | Emit actions, outputs, or effects into the environment | `O_emit()` |
| **Cause Trouble** | Trace unintended consequences or contradictions | `O_tracechain()` |
| **Reflect** | Re-evaluate internal state and rewrite intention | `O_revise()` |

```

### Cycle formula:

Reflection = f(Context, Action, Consequence)
Intuition' = Reflection(Intuition)

---

## 3. Integration in the DSL Engine
In your DSL runtime, Synthetic Naikan is implemented as a **meta-operator layer** that can wrap any reasoning or creative process:

```python
from dsl.modules.synthetic_naikan import NaikanCycle

with NaikanCycle(context="composition", telos="understanding") as cycle:
    cycle.receive("auditory motif from improvisation")
    cycle.give("harmonic structure encoded in Euclidean rhythm")
    cycle.cause("monotony detected by aesthetic evaluator")
    cycle.reflect()
````

Each cycle generates an **Observation Report** with metadata:

```yaml
Module: SyntheticNaikan
Input:  auditory motif
Output: harmonic structure
Conflict: monotony
Resolution: introduce asymmetry
```

## 4. Philosophical Dimension

| Axis    | Traditional Naikan        | Synthetic Naikan                   |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Subject | Human self                | Human + System composite           |
| Object  | Relationship              | Data / Causality graph             |
| Method  | Contemplation             | Iterative computation              |
| Outcome | Gratitude & moral clarity | Design awareness & ethical clarity |

> The moral domain of Naikan becomes the epistemic domain of Reflective Computing.

## 5. Applications

```markdown
| Domain                     | Example                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Software Design**        | Post-execution introspection: what did this module receive, produce, and break? |
| **Music Composition**      | Reflect on motif input, harmonic emission, aesthetic friction.                  |
| **Project Retrospectives** | Replace blame with structured reflection loops.                                 |
| **AI Ethics**              | Let agents perform Synthetic Naikan on their own decision traces.               |

## 6. Relationship to Other Modules

* **Aristotelian Biodome** → provides causal ontology used by Naikan to classify inputs/outputs.
* **Dialectic Modes** → supplies logic for reconciling conflicting introspections.
* **Tradeoff Lens** → quantifies tension between opposing reflections.

Together they create a “Reflective OS” where computation = conscience.

---

## 7. Future Work

1. Extend `NaikanCycle` to support temporal stacking (long-term introspection).
2. Visualize reflection chains as causal graphs.
3. Integrate with Observation Report renderer for public sharing.
