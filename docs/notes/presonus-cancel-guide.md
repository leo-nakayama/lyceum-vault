If the **“Cancel Membership”** button doesn’t appear in MyPreSonus:

1. Go to **My Products → Software → Studio One → Activations**  
2. **Delete all licensed devices** (deactivate registered computers)  
3. Wait ~10–60 minutes for backend sync  
4. Then go to **Account → Membership & Billing → Cancel Membership**

!!! note
    The cancel button only appears once no devices remain linked to the subscription.
